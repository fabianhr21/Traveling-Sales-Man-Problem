# Traveling-Sales-Man-Problem
With this code we try to find the shortest path can be set in a graph of N nodes starting from a node and ending in the same node passing through every node. Solution computed with a genetic algorithm on python.
The function to call is travelers(Muestras,Niter,Prob_mut,Nodos,CiudadInicial)
Where:
Muestras is the number of population for the genetic algorithm
Niter is the number of iterations
Prob_mut is the probability of a mutation is taking place on each generation
Cities is the number of cities
InitialCity is the starting and final city
